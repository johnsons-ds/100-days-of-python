Welcome to Johnsons Turtle Crossing Game

This is my second Capstone Project in the 100 Days of Code by Angela Yu. In this project, I will be
exploring the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by using classes. For this project I have
chose a 'Hard' difficulty level. This means that I have only used Steps 1 and 2 for the entire coding
challenge.

I hope you enjoy!
